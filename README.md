# ahx-recipe-randomizer

A demonstration project to show that web development without frameworks and Javascript is possible. The only tools used are Python, Flask, Html, and CSS.

The tabbed interface is inspired by
[Jason Knight:Tabbed Interfaces Without JavaScript](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/tabbed-interfaces-without-javascript-661bab1eaec8)

The recipes are from Mark Bittman's excellent book 'How to Cook Everything fast'.
